        <p>I am a Computer Science and Media student at HdM Stuttgart. Almost everything I work on is published on GitHub (as you can see, it is not much so far).</p>
        <p>Back in the days, a friend and myself had a youtube channel on which we published LEGO creations. <a hrsef="https://youtube.com/JakWai01">Here</a> is a link if you want to check it out.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I am working on projects like this website, going to the gym or meeting my friend.</p>
